<details>
  <summary>When I was back in Minnesota for winter break</summary>
  <details>
    <summary>I made 2024 vision boards with my closest friends</summary>
    <details>
      <summary>Not because we believed in “manifesting”</summary>
      <details>
        <summary>Just as a way to spend time together</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>To subtly celebrate everything we were working on</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>in school</summary>
            and in life.
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
    </details>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>We each signed one another’s boards.</summary>
    <details>
      <summary>These four collages were then packed into suitcases and spread across</summary>
      <details>
        <summary>four countries</summary>
        USA
        Canada
        Ireland
        Thailand
      </details>
    </details>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Looking at mine now</summary>
    <details>
      <summary>I can see how much of it focuses on IMSF and the earnestness behind each goal</summary>
      despite its silly tone
    </details>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Excerpts from a 2024 vision board:</summary>
    <br>
    <details>
      <summary><span style="font-family: RansomNote, sans-serif; font-size: 2em;">Supreme Leader</span></summary>
      <br>
      <details>
        <summary>Admittedly </summary>
        I didn’t apply to the program seeking social change or leadership skills
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>I was only looking to continue the work I started in Professor Faraj and Anand’s class </summary>
        <details>
          <summary>and connect my university learning to real world experience</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>Though these intentions may seem</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>misplaced</summary>
              they were sincere
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>The idea of being a leader made me uncomfortable</summary>
        even if I didn’t want it to
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Eight months later</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>while I still hesitate to call myself a leader</summary>
          or a rockstar
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>I <i>can</i> tell you what leadership means to me</summary>
        and feel the potential to be one in the future
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>One of the first lessons I learned about leadership is the importance of listening</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>Before the course, I had regarded listening as a valuable skill</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>but I had underestimated its power in leading change</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>Leadership can be glamorized as the notion that brilliant minds are struck </summary>
              <details>
                <summary>with brilliant ideas</summary>
                <details>
                  <summary>and it is those “following” who do the listening</summary>
                  We experienced first hand in our community consultations just how incorrect that portrayal can be
                </details>
              </details>
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>To truly understand the problem</summary>
          we needed to listen to people’s first hand experiences
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>This is also where we encountered our first problem</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>In trying so hard to ask the right questions and make the most of our interviews, we failed to listen to their answers</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>I remember one conversation we had with Ajung Moon</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>she suggested that analyzing access to technology and compute would be more influential in actually addressing inequality</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>At that point we were already so far into the project that we didn’t hear her</summary>
                <details>
                  <summary>I can’t definitely say if this is the direction our project should have gone in</summary>
                  <details>
                    <summary>but I can recognize</summary>
                    there were moments in which we were too narrowly focused
                  </details>
                </details>
              </details>
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>We also could have done a better job listening by engaging with a larger variety of people</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>Expert opinions were valuable, but they often framed the problem in one specific way</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>By limiting our interview pool to people with certain experiences, I feel we neglected those we were trying to help</summary>
              much like we accused big tech companies of doing
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>I think we understood the listening exercises and lecture on framing the problem at the time</summary>
          yet we struggled to effectively apply those two concepts in our project
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>The other thing that stands out to me about leadership is the ability to create momentum</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>For much of my high school and early college</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>I was under the assumption that if I followed the right steps</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>and waited for the right opportunity</summary>
              then things would fall into place
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Now</summary>
          I firmly believe in my ability to make things happen
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>This realization hit me when we interviewed Anouk Ruhaak</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>I had admired her work for some time and secretly hoped to follow in her footsteps of sorts</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>but before IMSF, I would have continued to stalk her website</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>maybe read about her work in my free time</summary>
                In my mind I was waiting until I had a certain skill set or position or experience to warrant reaching out to her
              </details>
            </details>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Thanks to IMSF, I simply sent her an email</summary>
            no more than a week and a half later we were interviewing her for our project
          </details>
        </details>
        Realizing I had the power to go after the things I wanted more actively and try to make them happen was an amazing feeling
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>At the winter retreat, David Lenke spoke about the importance of maintaining the “why”</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>but allowing the “how” to change</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>It is rallying around this evermoving “how” that requires momentum</summary>
            and ultimately a leader
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>As our initiative continued</summary>
            it took more effort to create momentum within the five of us in order to keep figuring out the “how”
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Another quote from David Lenke’s speech that has stuck with me is</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>“If something is worth doing, it’s worth doing badly.”</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>I wish someone had said this to me three years ago!</summary>
            (Although maybe I wouldn’t have been ready to hear it.)
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>So much of my waiting for things to happen, is waiting for something to be</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>perfect </summary>
              But waiting for the perfect “how” means you might never start
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>This is absolutely true with our impact initiative.</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>I would have waited until after school to even begin thinking about things like data transparency let alone trying to create a solution</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>What a waste!</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>I’ve learned</summary>
                <details>
                  <summary>SO</summary>
                  <details>
                    <summary>MUCH</summary>
                    <details>
                      <summary>about the problem</summary>
                      <details>
                        <summary>and about myself</summary>
                        <details>
                          <summary>in the process of doing it badly</summary>
                          (well not actually badly, just certainly not perfectly)
                        </details>
                      </details>
                    </details>
                  </details>
                </details>
              </details>

    <details>
      <summary><span style="font-family: RansomNote, sans-serif; font-size: 2em;">A Dream Team</span></summary>
      <br>
      <details>
        <summary>Putting “A Dream Team” on my vision board was easy</summary>
        because I already had it!
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>I was lucky enough to work with four beyond wonderful people</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>each with their own skills</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>and equally committed to the project and the process</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>the value of our team isn’t necessarily in the diversity of our skills or perspective, but in our dedication</summary>
              to keep showing up and determine what comes next.
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Their commitment has made our team incredibly special to me.</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>This was my first experience of truly collaborative group work</summary>
          the project felt like ours rather than mine alone
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Though, in doing everything together, we could have been more efficient and organized with our time</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>And sometime we were overly focused on problem-solving</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>this created an artificial urgency that prevented us from reflecting</summary>
              And ultimately from listening
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>There was a shift in the group dynamic during the second semester</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>As we began to shape our project, I do feel we sometimes had conflicting priorities</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>When the impact initiative went from a project to a startup itself, I had trouble vocalizing my concerns</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>I also felt there was an underlying assumption that as a computer science student I would be more responsible for the content of the guide</summary>
              Even though I was just as uncertain as everyone else
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>I felt uncomfortable using a guide that didn’t exist as the foundation for a startup</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>As a result</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>my participation in the second semester was performative at times; I didn’t have the same energy or enthusiasm</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>My reservations about the project definitely impacted morale in the group as I have a terrible poker face</summary>
                And there were moments it did get in the way of us moving forward
              </details>
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Despite this, I am still unbelievably proud of what my team accomplished and presented for showcase day</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>but I also know there is room for improvement</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>there is more work for us to do</summary>
            and I can't wait to start
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
    </details>
    <br>
    <details>
      <summary><span style="font-family: RansomNote, sans-serif; font-size: 2em;">Research Legend</span></summary>
      <br>
      <details>
        <summary>I included this because, like leadership, I still felt quite uncomfortable after that first semester</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>Despite my best efforts to be proactive to get the research project started, we certainly had a few setbacks</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>I had covid</summary>
            then the PhD student I was supposed to work with, Gina, unfortunately had an accident and was unavailable for the foreseeable future (she is okay now!)
          </details>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>By the time I was able to meet with Professor Faraj and Anand to course correct, it was clear the project would be quite different from what I had originally expected</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>With Gina, I would have been learning qualitative research skills and assisting the coding process of her ethnographic study</summary>
            Now, I would be exploring some data posted by the Quebec Ministry of Health and Social Services
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>I became overly worried about trying to figure out what I was supposed to do, what the right answer was (sounds familiar?)</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>I never considered what I could uniquely contribute or what I wanted to contribute</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>My nervousness and unease came through.</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>I still produced an analysis of the data</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>I learned a great deal about the Quebec health system</summary>
                <details>
                  <summary>I improved my R programming skills</summary>
                  but I can’t confidently say I managed-up
                </details>
              </details>
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>If I had the opportunity</summary>
        The research portion of the program is what I most wish I could redo
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>My dad also had an unexpected health emergency at the beginning of second semester</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>I was able to keep up with coursework and the impact initiative (for the most part)</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>but I neglected the research project for about a month</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>I was able to ask Anand for help and finish the project with his support</summary>
              but I'm not exceptionally proud of my contribution to their research
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>I definitely learned more about the process and how it compares to working in industry</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>but I also know I want to try another semester to be more engaged with the work before deciding if I might like to pursue it on my own</summary>
          I think I could do a better job, and contribute more creatively at each step, now knowing how open-ended the process is
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>I certainly have positive takeaways from the project too</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>I am incredibly grateful for Anand’s assistance throughout the year</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>Not only did he provide direction for the research project itself, but he routinely checked in and gave advice about my other courses and interests</summary>
            I don’t know what I would have done without him or the time he was willing to give me each week, especially second semester
          </details>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>I enjoyed participating in Bricolab meetings with the whole team</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>Being able to see other people at various stages of the research process and the types of things they were working on was probably the most helpful to seeing what research is like</summary>

              <summary>One meeting has stood out to me</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>This particular discussion was led by a special guest from another university about how scholarship, research, and academia will be impacted by AI</summary>
                <details>
                  <summary>I’m not a scholar, researcher, or academic; I still strongly identify with being a student</summary>
                  but I feel lucky I got to be in the room for such an interesting conversation, with my own questions and comments to add too
                </details>
              </details>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>I remember a particular comment about how we can treat reading as a technology and consider its transformative impact on the skills we practice and privilege now</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>in my head I just kept thinking “Yes!!!</summary>
                <details>
                  <summary>This is the kind of stuff I want to talk about</summary>
                  <details>
                    <summary>learn about</summary>
                    <details>
                      <summary>work on</summary>
                      <details>
                        <summary>This is the room I want to be in!”</summary>
                        <details>
                          <summary>So if that meeting is any indication of what research may be like</summary>
                          I definitely need to try again

          </details>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>While I felt relatively unsatisfied about my participation in the project as a whole</summary>
          I still liked the work I was able to contribute
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>I really enjoyed being able to present on showcase day</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>One of the values in learning for me is how I can share that process with other people</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>presenting reminded me there are lots of ways I can engage in that outside of class</summary>
              so much so that I'll be teaching piano lessons back in Minnesota this summer

      <details>
        <summary>By winter break I had come to realize how wonderful an opportunity the IMSF was</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>Viewing the semester solely as a set of deadlines makes it flash by without any time for me to reflect</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>I didn’t want to continue repeating this pattern </summary>
            <details>
              <summary>(though surprise, I did, but at least to a lesser degree than usual)</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>So when I set a goal to be “Immune to time”, I was essentially setting a goal to make the  most of this experience</summary>
                to enjoy it as much as possible
              </details>
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Showcase day as a whole was a moment to reflect</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>I was just immensely grateful for the chance to celebrate the hard work we all put in</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>Looking around the room, I could see the dedication and effort that both students and faculty had invested, and it was incredibly rewarding to have a day just to say thank you and congratulations</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>College can feel like a marathon, and sometimes we forget to celebrate the small wins along the way</summary>
              Thank you for making the day feel so special
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Moreover, I was just filled with awe and pride at the amazing IMSF fellows!</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>We spent so much time stressing over our own project that I completely forgot there were 60 other people doing the same thing</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>Actually seeing the presentations, the ways in which each team was creative and addressed the problem differently even if they shared an SDG was so motivating</summary>
              I just can’t wait to see what they’ll do next
            </details>
          </details>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>I’m far from immune — all I want is more time</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>More time to work on the impact initiative</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>more time to learn from my IMSF peers</summary>
              simply more of everything!

        <summary>A year ago, I was seriously considering dropping out of school</summary>
        I was struggling to see the value in what I was learning or why
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Fast forward to today, and everyday for the past some odd months</summary>
        <br>
        <details>
          <summary>I wake up filled with gratitude for the opportunity to simply try.</summary>

          <details>
            <summary>to listen</summary>

              <summary>to lead</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>to do something badly</summary>
                to do the things worth doing

        <summary>Maybe this sounds like an underwhelming revelation</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>but it couldn’t be farther from my mindset one year ago</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>Then, I was combative</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>framing everything as a test in which I needed to prove myself</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>And while that combative nature is still very much within me</summary>
                I also believe every single moment I am here learning and growing is a gift.

      <details>
        <summary>Now please bear with me, but I can tangibly feel the shift in my mindset</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>I’ve been meditating for almost two years now</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>after the worries of the week and stresses of the day are let go</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>underneath lies a well of gratitude</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>of resilience</summary>
                <details>
                  <summary>of courage</summary>
                  that wasn't there before

      <details>
        <summary>Some days it’s more present than others</summary>
        but regardless, I can’t overstate how important that growth is to me
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>This change was unconsciously reflected in my new values</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>Intuition and Wonder have remained important to me</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>But now so are gratitude and courage</summary>
            which I hadn’t even considered in the top 10 the first time we did the exercise
          </details>
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>If I want to be a leader in the future</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>It will take courage within myself to keep trying</summary>
          <details>
            <summary>but also a deep sense of gratitude</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>for the people and community who make it possible</summary>
              And ultimately make my courage mean something.
